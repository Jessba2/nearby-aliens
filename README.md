In this command line c++ game, search nearby star systems for intelligent life!
Which nearby star will you travel to? Will you find intelligent life and will these
beings be friendly or hostile? Will there be alien messages to decode?

Also, this project is easy to contribute to! With intermediate knowledge 
of C++ you can totally contribute. If you understand the program flow and functions you 
can make the art for levels. Look at the code for the function "makeAlphaCentauri" and 
use that as a model to make the ACSCII art for another star system.  

If you understand 2D static arrays, pointers, objects and classes - you are ready to go
for much more! Email me with questions. If you are unsure of your programming level 
grab one of the issues marked 'good for 1st issue'.
  
This project is super welcoming to all! Check out our code of conduct.

# Project Status
We are in the beginning stages of building this project. The gameboard in each level is an 
instance of the 'starSystem' class. Currently, we are adding functions that contribute to 
designing the art for the first five starSystem levels. We are also working on the 
functionality of moving from one 'tile' to another. The gameboard is a 30 by 11 array of tile*
pointers. Each tile is made up of 4by2 characters and represents approximately .2Au by .2Au of 
space.
